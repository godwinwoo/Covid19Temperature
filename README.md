# Covid19Temperature

This script takes the latest confirmed cases data from John Hopkins and the next 7 days weather high forecast, and plots 
a scatterplot along with a regression line and the r2 value in order to find the relationship between infection rate and
temperature. As more data is collected we hope that r2 will increase.   


To run the script:

1. Copy and overwrite latest time_series_19-covid-Confirmed.csv from 
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series into the Data folder.

2. Install all required imported packages into your python environment.

3. Execute the script.
