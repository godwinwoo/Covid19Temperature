# Covid19Temperature

This script takes the latest confirmed cases data from John Hopkins and the next 7 days weather high forecast, and plots 
a scatterplot along with a regression line and the r2 value in order to find the relationship between infection rate and
temperature. As more data is collected the r2 should increase.   


To run the script:

1. Copy and overwrite latest time_series_19-covid-Confirmed.csv from 
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series into the Data folder.

2. Install all required imported packages into your python environment.

3. Execute the script.
